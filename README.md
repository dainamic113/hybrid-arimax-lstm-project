# Hybrid ARIMAX-LSTM for DBO Price Forecasting

This project applies advanced time series modeling techniques to forecast the daily closing prices of the Invesco DB Oil Fund (DBO), an oil-backed ETF. It combines traditional statistical modeling (ARIMAX) with deep learning (LSTM) in a hybrid framework to capture both linear and nonlinear market dynamics.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Improve forecasting accuracy for DBO prices by leveraging a hybrid model that combines ARIMAX and LSTM.
- **Scope:** Evaluate standalone ARIMAX, standalone LSTM, and a hybrid ARIMAX-LSTM model using historical financial and economic data from 2010 to 2025.
- **Key Inputs:**
  - Historical DBO closing prices
  - Exogenous variables: WTI crude oil prices and USD index (DXY)
  - Technical indicators: Moving Averages, RSI, etc.

## 🛠️ Models Used

### 1. **ARIMAX**
- Captures linear temporal patterns with exogenous variables.
- Best-fit: ARIMAX(1,1,1)

### 2. **LSTM**
- Neural network for sequence modeling with 2 stacked LSTM layers and dense output layers.
- Trained with normalized technical indicators and sliding input windows.

### 3. **Hybrid ARIMAX-LSTM**
- Stage 1: ARIMAX forecasts linear structure.
- Stage 2: LSTM models ARIMAX residuals to capture nonlinear components.
- Final output = ARIMAX forecast + LSTM residual prediction.

## 📊 Results Summary

| Model   | MAE   | MAPE (%) | RMSE  |
|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| ARIMAX | 2.57  | 18.27    | 2.62  |
| LSTM   | 0.50  | 3.63     | 0.62  |
| Hybrid | **0.27** | **1.93** | **0.34** |

The hybrid model significantly outperformed standalone models, especially during periods of volatility.
